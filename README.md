# checkForPalindrome
To run the app:
 
1)cd into the nodeJs app and run node server.js
1)Run the .sln with visual studio that is located at : checkForPalindrome/PalindromeChecker/PalindromeChecker.sln
2)CTRL-F5 to run the application
3)type in the word to be checked and wait for the response.


4)unfortunately i was not able to connect it to an external server, so its not working as of right now.
but running the nodeJS with postman you will see that the logic works just fine.

5)this was my first time working with NodeJS directly
